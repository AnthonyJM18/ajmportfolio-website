Portfolio website to showcase my skills and such

This is a portfolio website created for the purpose of being added to my resume in order to showcase skills and projects to potential
employers.

Anyone is welcome to add any changes to enhance the look or feel of the website, all I ask is that you document functionality 
changes or additions so that I may learn how they work, and how they are programmed. 

Any suggestions are welcome!
